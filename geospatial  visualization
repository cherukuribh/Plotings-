Here I used Plotly to make geospatial  visualization. Because Plotly offers a complete solution to deploying web apps. 
With Plotly Express intuitive API and Dash Plotly, you can take your geospatial web applications and visualisations to the next level.

import pandas as pd
#import chart_studio.plotly as py
import plotly.offline as po
import plotly.graph_objs as pg
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
po.init_notebook_mode(connected = True)
AE = pd.read_csv('geo_data.csv')
AE.head(10)
data1 = dict(type = 'choropleth', 
            locations = AE['WD21NM'], 
            locationmode = 'country names', 
            z = AE['BNG_E'], 
            text = AE['WD21CD'])
layout = dict(title = 'Wards in Great Britain as at December 2021', 
              geo = dict(scope = 'world', 
                         showlakes = True, 
                         lakecolor = 'rgb(0,191,255)'))
x = pg.Figure(data = [data1], 
              layout = layout)
po.iplot(x)
